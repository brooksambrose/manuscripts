#1. Introduction

This collection of studies seeks to accomplish a simplistic goal. I wish to enumerate schools of thought in the historical record of U.S. social science scholarship. While this is little more than a census-taking exercise, what will become interesting about it is what we must learn when taking operationalization seriously. By attempting to resolve difficulties that arise between ontology (what we assume is there) and observation (what we see when we actually look), I am forced to update my sociological imagination. While the studies below are empirical their purpose is theoretical in the imaginary sense. I do not seek an unbiased view of the world, but merely to move in an unbiased direction.

In Chapter 2 I begin by achieving clarity on what I think a school of thought is ontologically, a particular set of patterns among personalities, cultures, and social structures. From the perspective of this orienting theory in Chapter 3 I take a critical look at the work of three theorists of intellectual development, Jen Lena, Thomas Kuhn, Harry Collins. In Chapter 4 I motivate the selection of the U.S. social sciences as a case of intellectual development. In Chapter 5 I introduce the source material for the studies that follow. In Chapter 6 I execute five brief empirical studies that test different aspects of my expectations about intellectual communities and their development. In Chapters 7 and 8 I summarize findings and discuss limitations of the study. In Chapter 9 I conclude by updating the theory building of Chapters 2 and 3 with the results of the studies.
